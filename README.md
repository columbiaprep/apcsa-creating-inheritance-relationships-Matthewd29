# CGPS Adventure Game

## Lab 3.1: Creating Inheritance Relationships

### Objectives:
Students will have to add and modify existing classes to create the structure of our Adventure game.

### Adding new classes
Using the UML diagram provided by Ms. Schott, add the following classes. Include the specified instance variables and remove any that are unnecessary.

- Entity
- Stats
- Monster
- Adventurer
- Item
- Consumable
- Equipment
- Weapon
- Armor

You do not need to code anything extra for the classes; just set up the inheritance relationships at this time.

### Modifying existing classes
Per the UML diagram, modify the existing classes to utilize inheritance or compositional relationships.

#### Adventurer
Move Stats and the related methods to the Stats class.
